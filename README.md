# Senior_Capstone

Summary:

In my senior capstone project, I'm using R to built a Logistic Regression model that determines the likelihood of potential borrowers having payment difficulties 
based on a Home Credit dataset from Kaggle.

Files:

Senior_Capstone.pdf - this is the final paper that I submitted for grading that details the project and also include references and codes at the end of the paper.

Accept or Reject Clients' Loan Applications.pptx - this is a slideshow that I use to present my project to the Math department

R_Codes - this is the R codes that I wrote for the project (data preparation, modeling and simulations)
